                    Furthermore, I also took part in helping the Research team conduct UX Practices, including comparative analyses and usability testing.

                <p>The storyboard sketches made here are meant to display how potential users can benefit from the tool we were in the early stages of creating. 
                    From my end, I envisioned two different stories that successfully displayed the struggle of users trying to find readable and accessible 
                    data to help them in their journeys to solve the issues they aim to solve within their community. By displaying these difficulties, 
                    the team is able to get a better sense of what audiences we need to design our tool for and how to better design our tool for them.</p>

                <h2 style="font-weight:bold; color:#2D3047; margin-bottom: 25px;"> Wireframes </h2>
                <p> As we were finishing with the initial research we have conducted for the front-end features, layout and accessibility that would be hosted by our tool, 
                    we eased into the phase of creating wireframes for the mobile layout of the website. This was done so that it would be easier for the developers to create a 
                    mobile-first responsive site. With this goal in mind, I started to create low- to mid-fidelity wireframes to have an initial construction of how certain aspects and content will be structured within the site.
                    <br><br>As I started working on the low-fi wireframes, I made sure to first focus on the layout of content as there were many different subjects and topics that were important to highlight for the first MVP and the design team needed an initial vision to help us see what could work and what couldn’t. I crafted the header, footer, and navigation menu to help centralize the information and allow for a more visible layout of the site’s structure. Other features I focused on creating besides content layout were the button look, the schedule interface, and announcement blocks.
                    <br><br>The wireframes displayed on the left are the mid-fi ones, which include the coloring and typography that were yet to be finalized, but useful for visualizing altogether. Finishing these wireframes were crucial in conceptualizing the structure of the site and allowed us to easily arrange the content for the site’s desktop version as well.

            <!-- Mockups -->
        <div class = "row flex-grow-1 artifact">
            <div class = "col-md-6 text">
                <h2 style="font-weight:bold; color:#2D3047; margin-bottom: 25px;"> Mockups </h2>
                <p>After receiving feedback from both team members and individuals from usability testing, we were in a comfortable spot to start the mockups and prototypes for the tool. 
                    As we reached this position, a lot of the other design aspects were also being finalized as well, including the color palette, the logo, typography, and content of the site, 
                    thanks to some A/B Testing, initial usability testing, and prototyping with the mid-fi wireframes.
                    <br><br>With all of these design points available to use for the wireframes, it was all a matter of putting it all together. I, along with a fellow team member, were tasked with constructing the mockups and laying out all the content and features. I did work on editing the layouts and adjusting certain sizes of fonts, images and buttons to give the reader a more friendly interface.
                    <br><br> Another main task I performed was making an interactive prototype out of the wireframes on Figma. Connecting all of the links and pages together allowed for an easier method of conducting usability tests and an easier way for us to visualize how the site will not only look, but feel for our potential users. You can see an example of one of the interactive prototypes I made linked below! Furthermore, one aspect that we had aimed to test out with potential users was a carousel function for the home page. Though it seemed much difficult to perform on Figma for the team, I managed to do some research on component variants within Figma and created a working carousel prototype for both the mobile and desktop versions of the mockups, facilitating the user testing for this functionality later on.
                    <br><br>Through many different test phases, a mockup and prototype were finally born and were available to be put to the test by our test users.

                    NOTE: This was one of the final mockups during my time on the team. This may or may not reflect the final version the current team decides on.
