                <p>Access the Data is a volunteer-based initiative that aims to expand the access of local government data to all 
                    communities as well as providing ways to teach individuals easier ways to understand and analyze these datasets and 
                    use them for their own benefit.

                <p>Access the Data is one project within the community of Hack for LA, a brigade of civic-minded tech volunteers dedicated 
                    to using their skills to develop tools for communities in need. Find out more about Access the Data and Hack for LA <a href="https://www.hackforla.org/#">here</a>.

                <p>In my time as a UI/UX Designer, I assisted in propelling the Design team to reach the first MVP and first usability 
                    testing period by helping in the creation of storyboards, sketches, mockups, and interactive prototypes. 
                    Furthermore, I also took part in helping the Research team conduct UX Practices, including comparative analyses and usability testing.

                <p>The storyboard sketches made here are meant to display how potential users can benefit from the tool we were in the early stages of creating. 
                    From my end, I envisioned two different stories that successfully displayed the struggle of users trying to find readable and accessible 
                    data to help them in their journeys to solve the issues they aim to solve within their community. By displaying these difficulties, 
                    the team is able to get a better sense of what audiences we need to design our tool for and how to better design our tool for them.</p>
