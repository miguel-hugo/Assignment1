                            As an Informatics major with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction, I have attained a lot of experience with 
                            the process of UI/UX design, gaining a proficiency in tools like Figma or Miro to conduct my design projects and assignments.

            <p style="padding: 25px 100px 0px 100px;">
                When I'm not working, you will most likely catch me on perusing through social media or playing games on my phone. But I also enjoy gaming on my PC, 
                watching horror movies, laughing at YouTube videos, and constantly going bankrupt by eating out!
