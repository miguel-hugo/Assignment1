                    <p>As an undergraduate research assistant, I was initially brought onto the team with two responsibilities: 
                        undergoing research on the usage and effects of data dashboards and creating/maintaining the lab website, 
                        the latter of which is the focus of this page. </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "col-md-12 main">
                <p>Throughout my time as an assistant, I familiarized myself with WordPress to single 
                    handedly create the site and organize the content of the lab. Furthermore, I also took charge in redesigning the 
                    visual aspects of the lab, including the logo and theme colors. Below are some of the artifacts that went into 
                    creating the site.

                    One of the tasks I was responsible for was to redesign the lab logo. 
                    The supervisor wanted a more isometric logo compared to the more outdated logo. 
                    After sifting through numerous inspirations and creating multiple brainstorming sketches, 
                    I was able to come up with the logo you see displayed here using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
                    <br><br>
                    The house was created with an isometric perspective with an E marked on the wall to represent the Evoke name. 
                    Furthermore, the door is left open as a way to represent the inclusivity that the lab consistently promotes as a value. 
                    Overall, it serves as a simple, unique, and meaningful logo to represent the lab.

                <h2 style="font-weight:bold; color:#5c88c5; margin-bottom: 25px;"> Typography </h2>
                <p> To choose the typography for the site, I had to consider two necessary aspects with the fonts I choose: something that is 
                    easy to read and something that stands out. For inspiration, I scoured through numerous research lab websites to look for fonts that were both distinct and simple. One major source of inspiration I had found was with the 
                    Data Justice Lab website where they had used the font “Courier” for most of the text on their site. 
                    <br><br>Inspired by the uniqueness, yet simplicity, of the Courier font, I first chose to go with the “Space Mono” and “Roboto” pairing as it had provided both of the features I had been initially looking for. I had decided to use two separate fonts because I personally thought the universality of a single font throughout the whole site can wear out the user, so having two different fonts brings more opportunity for creativity. The Space Mono font served as a futuristic and  eye-catching heading to draw the user in, while the Roboto was used as a neat and easy-to-read font for the smaller text that the user would have to read.
                    <br><br>However, one thing I, along with the other lab students, had noticed was that the Space Mono was a little too funky looking for the site. I had realized that by getting so lost in finding a prominent font, it did not come into my mind that the heading typeface I chose would not have been an appealing choice for the target audience. As a result, I decided to switch to a different pairing that WordPress offered, which are the current “Cabin” and “Raleway” fonts. The heading font, Cabin, offered a smoother, yet equally striking, font for the reader and the Raleway provided the same experience as Roboto, but was a better contrast for the Cabin font than its predecessor.
