                    <p>As an undergraduate research assistant, I was initially brought onto the team with two responsibilities: 
                        undergoing research on the usage and effects of data dashboards and creating/maintaining the lab website, 
                        the latter of which is the focus of this page. </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "col-md-12 main">
                <p>Throughout my time as an assistant, I familiarized myself with WordPress to single 
                    handedly create the site and organize the content of the lab. Furthermore, I also took charge in redesigning the 
                    visual aspects of the lab, including the logo and theme colors. Below are some of the artifacts that went into 
                    creating the site.
                </p>

            <div class = "col-md-12 main">
                <p style="font-weight:bolder; ">NOTE: The current EVOKE website has been redesigned by the new research assistant.

                <p>
                    One of the tasks I was responsible for was to redesign the lab logo. 
                    The supervisor wanted a more isometric logo compared to the more outdated logo. 
                    After sifting through numerous inspirations and creating multiple brainstorming sketches, 
                    I was able to come up with the logo you see displayed here using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
                    <br><br>
                    The house was created with an isometric perspective with an E marked on the wall to represent the Evoke name. 
                    Furthermore, the door is left open as a way to represent the inclusivity that the lab consistently promotes as a value. 
                    Overall, it serves as a simple, unique, and meaningful logo to represent the lab.
