                <p style="font-style: italic;">"Itâ€™s hard finding and deciding on a place to eat with friends, given the overwhelming number of options we have on the market. 
                    Our group aims to solve that with Thyme, an app that consolidates the best restaurants in your area, and uses a quick and easy 
                    group voting system so you and your friends can decide which to go to." </p>

                <p>To reiterate from our problem statement, Thyme is a 
                    decision-making tool that allows indecisive groups to decide the best restaurant to eat from by using an efficient voting system. 
                    The tool also allows users to search through restaurants around the user's area, create and save groups, save favorite restaurants, and more. 
                    Below are some of the artifacts I personally worked on, which included but is not limited to: surveys, personas, sketches, and prototypes.
