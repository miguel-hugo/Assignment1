                    Our group aims to solve that with Thyme, an app that consolidates the best restaurants in your area, and uses a quick and easy 
                    group voting system so you and your friends can decide which to go to." </p>

            <div class = "col-md-12 main">
                    <p>To reiterate from our problem statement, Thyme is a 
                        decision-making tool that allows indecisive groups to decide the best restaurant to eat from by using an efficient voting system. 
                        The tool also allows users to search through restaurants around the user's area, create and save groups, save favorite restaurants, and more. 
                        Below are some of the artifacts I personally worked on, which included but is not limited to: surveys, personas, sketches, and prototypes.

                <h2 style="font-weight:bold; color:#5CC584; margin-bottom: 25px;">Surveys</h2>
                <p>After determining our problem statement, we decided to initiate our research phase for our product in order to establish who we are catering this product to. And to do so, I contributed in the creation of a short, 5-minute Google Forms survey that we distributed to our Informatics 132 class as a means of gathering information about the behavioral patterns of people who use technology in their decision to eat away from home.<br><br>
                    After 30 people responded, the survey results gave our team a lot of insights that set the path for the rest of our design process. For example, an insight that stood out to me was how many people considered the approval voting (majority option) style to be the most fair and efficient system as compared to a ranking style. It personally changed my design mindset because I had thought that the ranking option would be of utmost efficiency, yet the people had proved me wrong.<br><br>
                    The survey ended up holding a lot of influence over the design process as it had given the team a multitude of ideas that we ensured to keep throughout the creation of our product. Some ideas that we incorporated are the approval voting system, awareness to dietary restrictions (which participants had said was an obstacle to eating out), and easier way to search for restaurants.</p>

                <h2 style="font-weight:bold; color:#5CC584; margin-bottom: 25px;">Personas</h2>
                <p>After concluding our research phase, we needed to consolidate our main insights in regards to what our potential users' desires and pains were and through our survey results, we were able to do so through personas. As a team, we each created one persona that we thought would represent our average user demographic and we would later present them and discuss our similarities in our design studio.<br><br>
                    With the persona I made, I used the survey participants' data to create Mark John, a college student who, along with his friend group, struggles choosing how and where to eat altogether. In the persona, I presented his background, goals, desires, his familiarity with technology, as well as a fictitious scenario, all of which encompassed a certain theme I found among the survey data, along with the rest of my team's personas.<br><br>
                    Through our persona presentations during the design studio, my team and I were able to gather ideas about what features we could implement in our app (i.e., dietary restrictions) and who our design should cater to (i.e., millennials vs. teens/young adults). In the end, the personas served as a great tool to utilize throughout the latter half of the design process because it allowed me to be considerate of design features by visualizing who would be using this tool.</p>

            <!-- Sketches -->
        <div class = "row flex-grow-1 artifact">
            <div class = "col-md-6 text">
                <h2 style="font-weight:bold; color:#5CC584; margin-bottom: 25px;">Sketches</h2>
                <p>While the personas brought in a discussion of the who behind the design, the sketches provided the design's what and how. Our team and I each came up with between 25-50 sketches regarding our ideas for features within Thyme's UI design (i.e., Onboarding, Restaurant Search, Voting, etc.) in order to visually represent our users' desires.<br><br>
                    I utilized aspects of my persona's technology usage patterns to create a handful of sketches that embodied a social media UI. My sketches, shown in a grid pattern on the right, are substantial in elements that are inspired by apps like Instagram and Postmates. For example, many pages display a tab bar similar to many social media apps and we see card-style elements to display restaurants, much the same as food delivery apps.<br><br>
                    The layout of these sketches aimed to represent 2 versions of different pages our group aspired to create, with one version on the top row and another version right below, alternating every two rows.<br><br>
                    After creating these sketches, our team narrowed down the look and feel we had wanted to create in this design. For example, my sketches inspired the desire for a tab bar as a means of navigation throughout the app, card-style representation for restaurants, a voting history section, etc.</p>

                <h2 style="font-weight:bold; color:#5CC584; margin-bottom: 25px;">UI Design</h2>
                <p>After narrowing down the design, our group moved on to the next stage of our design process which was to create a mid-fi iPhone mockup as our UI design on the Figma.<br><br>
                    With the UI design, we decided to go with a minimalistic, fresh approach with a simple color scheme. Because the name of our product is Thyme, I had brought up the idea to the team that we stick to a simple light green color scheme as a way to complement our product name with the added benefit of having a welcoming UI display for our users. This color scheme can be seen exemplified on the left with certain elements having our algae green color.<br><br>
                    What resulted from our Figma mockup is a fresh, modern app design that embodies a trendy, yet efficient way of choosing where to eat. I am really proud of our (somewhat-) final product for so many reasons. I really enjoyed having our color scheme match our name because I think it really pulls everything together. I also admired how the UI design was similar to our sketches and included the features we had hoped to have.<br><br>
                    In the end, the UI design serves as the answer to the goals and pains our participants expressed. It provides an approval voting system that a majority of our participants expressed desire for, it allows users to center on a restaurant that fulfills their cravings, it considers people's dietary restrictions, etc. Overall, our UI was an amazing culmination of everything we worked on for the past ten weeks and I am glad to have helped create a design that can solve many people's problems.</p>

                <p>These past ten weeks have shown me how thorough, yet fun the UI/UX design process was! Although a lot of work went into drawing sketches, constructing personas, producing mockup UI designs, etc., I am still so appreciative that my time was well spent learning how to do all of these kinds of work properly. 
                    I will say that the biggest (and somewhat the most surprising) thing I could have ever learned was how crucial sketches are in the design process. I never knew something so low effort and basic like sketches can inspire/translate into the final designs that we made, which was something that really shocked me. 
                    In the end, I am happy to have pushed through all the uncertainties and difficulties with this project and to have helped produce our remarkable app, Thyme.</p>
